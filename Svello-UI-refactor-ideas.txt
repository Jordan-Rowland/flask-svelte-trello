Svello UI refactor


- New list option shows after current lists:
    - Clicking on this brings up the text area for the list name + add-list button

- New card option shows after current cards:
    - Clicking on this brings up the text area for the card name + add-card button

- Card min size smaller, max size larger
    - fixed width smaller

- Lists closer together

- Edit button on side of cards
    - Button only appears on hover

- Add-list separate component??

- Drop-Down menu for lists

- Edit card modal
